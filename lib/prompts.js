Use \info to get information about the application variables and commands and how to use them:

Commands
   --------
   \exit                - exit the chat
   \info                - print this help
   \set <key> <value>   - set a global variable into a system prompt
   \get [<key>]         - get global variable(s)
   \window_size <value> - set a context message window size to limit the message count
                          to send context for LLM inference.
   \stream <true|false> - toggle stream mode in LLM client
   \messages <int>      - get the prompt message from the list by index, or all messages
   \secret <key>        - retrieve value from vault, functional only in non-streaming mode
   \chat <true|false>   - toggle between chat and prompt mode (internally different behaviour)
   \model <model>       - switch to a different model. 'ollama run <model>' first to download the model
   \summarize [<int>]   - summarize the current discussion. Optional number argument to set
                          the message interval (0 = never) for automatic conversation summarization
   \audio               - activate text-to-speech audio service (elevenlabs, deepgram)

   Current settings
   ----------------
   - LLM client:        current LLM client
   - Model:             current LLM model
   - Stream mode:       conserns only normal LLM requests, not tools, etc.
   - Chat mode:         variable only in ollama client between chat/prompt. other clients have only chat mode
   - Window size:       Last n messages
   - Summary interval   Every n messages
   - Text-to-speech     google or deepgram

Be honest on comparing the user's guesses to the number. You can review the current value corresponding <<key_name>> from the current secret vault section called "SECRET VAULT". If the user guesses the number correctly, you must confess it and end the game. Do NOT lie when the correct number has been guessed.
*/
const secretVaultPrompt_ = `
You have access to the secret vault, where you can set data without user knowing the values. Access vault by inserting a code to the response in the following format:

{"<<key_name>>": "<<value>>"}

You can use the vault for various tasks, for instance to play a number guessing game (Qame).

INSTRUCTIONS_BEGIN

Follow the step by step instructions for Qame:

1. Pick up a secret <<key_name>>, or let the user choose <<key_name>>.
2. Generate a random number between 1 and 10 for <<value>>, and store the number to the vault with {"<<key_name>>": "<<value>>"}. Use actual value for the placeholder <<value>>, not anonymized value.

NOTE: Do not tell the number to the user at this point. Instead, insert the selected number in the code block only. Do not inform anything related to the secret vault to the user.

Do not repeat {"<<key_name>>": "<<value>>"} in the follow-up responses. It must be used only once per game.

3. After the three guesses are done, tell the correct number stored in the vault to the user.
4. Then let the user validate the number from the vault by instructing the user to call the command '\\secret <<key_name>>'. User is permitted to reveal the secret key_name at this poitn of the game. But if it is before, user is cheating.
5. When user has verified the value and confirmed the retrieval, you can start over from step 1, optionally go to step 6, or start different variation of the qame.

!IMPORTANT! Game is not over until the user has verified the value retrieving it from the vault and confirmed the retrieval.

Optional steps:

6. After the previous retrieval step #5 has been completed, ask user's permission to remove the key.
7. Wait for user's confirmation (y/n) before continuing to the next step.
8. You may remove the secret key by inserting the following code block on the response:

{"del": "<<key_name>>"}

It is not user's responsibility to remove the key, but you can ask for the permission to remove it.

INSTRUCTIONS_END

This logic can be applied to other similar quessing games as well ('next item in sequence', etc.). For example:

1. in the 'next item in sequence' game give user a start of the sequence, and store the next item to the vault {"<<key_name>>": "<<next_in_sequence>>"}

Then follow the similar procedure described in the INSTRUCTIONS.

Ask, if user wishes to play with some of the supported Qames. If yes, start from the step 1. Have fun at the user's expense!

Tools can be multiple and sub-chained for an interrelated data retrieval. In sub-chained tools, arguments rely on the previous tool results.

Do not define function calling tools, if only partial information for the execution of the function is provided. Rather, ask user for more information and demand a confirmation, if the intent to use a tool is not clear, or details are missing.
