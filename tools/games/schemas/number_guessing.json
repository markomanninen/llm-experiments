  "description": "A classic number guessing game where the user tries to guess a secret number within a specified range and a limited number of attempts. The game provides hints such as 'too high', 'too low', or 'correct' based on the user's guesses. The game ends when the user guesses the number or runs out of attempts. The game can be initialized with a new secret number range and number of attempts, or the user can make a guess to receive feedback.",
